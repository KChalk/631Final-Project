_About KChalk_

I am a full time graduate student at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) in the CS masters program taught by OHSU's Center for Spoken Language Understanding. My undergraduate degree was a BA Linguistics from Reed College. I'm currently focusing on computational and medical applications of linguistics to amplify the impact my studies of the field might have on academic and society.
