 Audience The end user intended audience is rather general, but can be divided into a few likely subgroups:
Linguists interested in this method of textual analysis and the language of internet forums Computer sciencists interested in potential uses of distributed computing Social scientists studying mood and anxiety disorders such as major depression or generalized anxiety disorder  However, with this graph in particular, the most important thing is a quick glance at the data, and one should probably use actual statistics before deciding to subset the data as I’m about to suggest.</description>

      <description>Graph 2 Dictionary Rain cloud Data All the graph in this series are generated from data concerning frequency with which words from assorted dictionaries appear in original reddit posts from various subreddits. For the second of these graphs, I’m using a dataset called alldicts (in its long form: alldictslong) which includes many of the same columns as allsubs, including absoltist frequecies of absolutist words as well as frequencies of words in 64 other dictinoaries:</description>
